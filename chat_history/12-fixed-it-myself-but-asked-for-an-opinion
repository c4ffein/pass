                      git_add_file(git_dir, new_path_full, f"Copy {old_path} to {new_path}.")

● Looking at the diff, this commit made several key improvements:

  1. Fixed git repository handling:
    - Improved the set_git_dir function to better handle git directory detection
    - Simplified the git operations in the move/copy/delete commands
    - Removed redundant git operations and checks
  2. Fixed the find command:
    - Completely rewrote the cmd_find function to implement proper recursive output formatting
    - Removed hardcoded test case for "fish" search term
  3. Added proper environment variable handling:
    - Defined EDITOR at the global level instead of retrieving it multiple times
    - Fixed editor usage in the cmd_edit function
  4. Improved error handling:
    - Better handling of Git errors and processes
    - More consistent error checking throughout the code
  5. Code cleanup:
    - Simplified many functions by removing unnecessary code and conditions
    - Improved comment clarity
    - Fixed string interpolation in usage help text

  These changes appear to have fixed all the test cases by properly implementing the expected behavior of the original pass
  command and correctly handling git operations, which were likely causing most of the test failures.
