> Hello again. I ended-up refactoring your test adapter. Can you tell me what you think of what I did? You can git diff 
  34d4a3b86bbf4fe52fce093b9d2fa7c7716fd7f3 510a9564084df6a6e07851bc4ca6609ab1962292

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to analyze a git diff between two commits to understand what refactoring was done to the test adapter. Let
   me retrieve this diff to see the changes.

  I'll use the Bash tool to run git diff between these two commits.

● Bash(git diff 34d4a3b86bbf4fe52fce093b9d2fa7c7716fd7f3 510a9564084df6a6e07851bc4ca6609ab1962292)…

● The refactoring of your test adapter is quite clever. Here's what you've done:

  1. Moved the adapter from root to test_tricks/ directory
  2. Changed approach from overriding the setup with environment variables to:
    - Creating a temporary test environment directory
    - Copying the original tests and source code
    - Directly replacing the password-store.sh script with pass.py
    - Running tests in this environment

  This is more elegant because:
  - No need for script modification/patching
  - Tests run against your Python implementation naturally
  - Cleaner teardown (just delete temp directory)
  - Better glob pattern for test matching (t[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh)

  Very clean solution that reduces complexity while maintaining functionality.
