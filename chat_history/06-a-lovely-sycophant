> Hello again. I made some modifications to your Makefile update. What do you think? You can just: git diff 
  a90e3251978d2e54a66f7417c2791d9fb398ac7f b6a4b06b6074737ed43d904c5e7f7312e63210c5 -- Makefile

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to display the difference between two specific git commits for the Makefile. They've provided the commit 
  hashes:
  - a90e3251978d2e54a66f7417c2791d9fb398ac7f (before)
  - b6a4b06b6074737ed43d904c5e7f7312e63210c5 (after)

  I'll use the git diff command to show the changes between these two commits, focusing only on the Makefile.

● The Makefile has been significantly simplified. The main changes:

  1. Removed the hardcoded TESTS_DIR variable
  2. Simplified the list-tests command
  3. Replaced the verbose list-missing-tests and generate-missing-test-targets with a more concise diff-tests-list command that
  directly compares tests in the Makefile against files in the tests directory

  The new approach is much cleaner and accomplishes the same goal with less code.
