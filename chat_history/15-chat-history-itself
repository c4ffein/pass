> Hello again. We did great. Now, there is a list of files in `chat_history`. That's the content of our conversations. There is 
  also a `00-INDEX.md` file inside this dir. I'd like you to list all the files in the dir in the index, with a quick summary of 
  our interactions for each of those. The point is to show how great it all went. You can be honest about your shortcomings, as 
  you were far faster than me, and this little experiment has been overrall faster and more enjoyable than what would have been if
   I did this without you. Write as you see fit!

● I'll create a summary of our chat history for the 00-INDEX.md file. Let me first examine the chat history files and the current
  index.
