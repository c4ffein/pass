All I did was:
- Load the initial implementation in a submodule (in case we may want to update the test suite...) so that he had access to both the initial implementation and the tests.
- Let him generate the initial `CLAUDE.md` file, he understood very well the structure of this repository and described it in quite a straightforward way.
- Added a few short sentences about what I wanted us to do.
- Asked `> I updated the CLAUDE.md file. What should we do now?`
- After that, I only said yes to everything. Some tests still don't pass, but those are edge cases. He did follow my recommendations, and built the perfect adapter to run the tests in the original submodule with the new `pass.py` he just built
- And actually, I just checked, those tests executed with the existing bash implem... See `chat-history/02-fixing-test-suite` to see how I only needed to prompt for a fix - will make a cleaner alternative myself though

You can check the `chat-history` to follow the rest of our changes, I try to only give overall directions and not micromanage: it's funny seeing Claude making little mistakes, and fixing them just as fast as he made those...  
Feels like watching a beginner, but 10x, or even 100x faster... Maybe in 4 or 5 years I'll have to find something else to do with my life  
Obviously, this is just a quick experiment for now, and I must say that was quite pleasant  
Maybe I'll still write some code for some very specific tasks in this repo, but I try to let Claude do as much as he can
